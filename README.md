The Jupyter notebook files contain information about watermark generation and demodulation. If you read our paper, filenames are self explanatory. 
The matlab files are just for plotting the results.
In this repository, we have not uploaded experimental data. Data file size is too big. We just provided information for those who want to experiment pseudonymetry in POWDER.
If you would like the data for further postprocessing, please contact me at: Meles99@gmail.com so that I can share the data with you.
To run the Pseudonymetry over-the-air experiment on [POWDER](https://powderwireless.net/), select the [Pseudonymetry-Experiment-Shout](https://www.powderwireless.net/show-profile.php?uuid=7fc0478f-d773-11ee-9f39-e4434b2381fc) and follow the step-by-step instructions.
